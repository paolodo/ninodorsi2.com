In my training experience, i started like **you**,

jumping and trying a different machine and different type of training but i felt not inside my body I couldn’t move with any pain and my **posture** was stuck.

After my graduation, i discovered the **functional training** this new concept for me and I started to study more about that. I started to buy the first book and then going online and then I have tried a course and then I was starting to **training** myself in that way.

Now I don’t look anymore at the machine but I feel my body and i **move** my joints and muscle for the reason why are created.

The results are I fell more coordinated more flexible and with my posture is improved,

 
_Move Soon._
