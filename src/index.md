I’ve been a waiter, builder, ice cream maker, barman, volleyball coach, group leader, a trainer in the gym.

I started to study Sports Science and since then I found my passion for discovering how our body works.

Then after the graduation, I felt that there was something left to be learned and so I started to improve them and I discovered the [Functional Training](/posts/fun-ctional-training/).

Now I’m [Movement Coach](https://www.exuberantanimal.com/blog/our-work-matters), trying to find  a solution how to be involved with the body it’s exactly what I share with my students today.

I like to listen to the people, because i feel more connected.

Italian native, I now live in Brussels.

My favorite quote: “Warning: Before beginning an program of physical inactivity, consult your doctor. Sedentary living is abnormal and dangerous to your health.” ― Frank Forencich, Exuberant Animal.

That is what I’m doing [now](/posts/now/)!
